# LeetCode → GitHub Sync 🚀

A Chrome extension that automatically syncs accepted LeetCode solutions to GitHub repositories.

---

## ✨ Why this exists

Keeping LeetCode solutions on GitHub is great for:
- Tracking DSA consistency
- Building a public proof-of-work
- Maintaining a clean contribution graph

But manually copying code is boring and error-prone.

This extension **automates the entire workflow** — solve on LeetCode, and your code appears on GitHub.

- ✅ Auto-pushes **accepted** LeetCode solutions
- 📂 Organizes code by **language / problem**

## 🛠️ How it works

2. On acceptance, the extension captures the solution  
3. Code is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository  
4. Your DSA journey stays public and consistent
